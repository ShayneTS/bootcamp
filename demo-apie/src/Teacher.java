public class Teacher {
  public static int candyCount = 23;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // OOP
    // 5 Students, 23 Candy

    // Student1.getCandyCount() -> 5
    // 5 5 5 4 4 (this is the answer)

    // student id = 3, candyCount? (e.g.)
    // write a programme to present this idea
    // tip: 23 is a counter


    // ! Bonus (Teacher.java, Student.java, Candy.java)
    // distribute candy is a for loop
    // Without using static candyCount, we use Teacher object to hold the 23 candy
    // Candy Object with color, distribute to 5 students

    // Answer: Teacher has no candy in the end. Each student has his own Cnady with dif. color
  }
